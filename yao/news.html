    <div id="entrytitle">Yao still alive and kicking</div>
    <div id="entrybody">
      Just to mention that, even though this feed has been very silent for many years, yao is still alive and in development &mdash; although probably not as actively as it used to be. But as you see below, we have recently added new features; some have not been documented properly I'm afraid, perhaps I will catch up on these later. The main developer (Francois) has less time to take care of it, having other responsibilities &mdash;this happens when you get older&mdash;, but developments are still going on and we have the occasional contribution from Marcos van Dam and Jesse Cranney. Again, if you are a user, let us know. We're also happy to answer questions if you have any.

            There is now a feature to rotate WFSs (only SH for now) independently from each other (and from the rest of the system). To quote yao_structures.i (wfs structure):
<pre style="width:63%; overflow-x: auto; word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">
  float   shift(2);       // WFS X/Y shift in pixels (it's shift first, rotation after). Set "use_fftshift" to use FFT method to shift. A positive shift value moves the WFS (ulens array) toward positive values in the pupil coordinate system (i.e. the pupil illumination moves opposite)
  float   rotation;       // WFS rotation in degrees (CCW). Set "use_fftrotate" to use FFT method to rotate.
</pre>
I have also included a couple of new parfiles in examples: <b>sh16x16_wfsrot.par</b> and <b>mcao_wfsrot.par</b>. In there, for instance:
<pre>
wfs(1).rotation       = 30.; // degrees CCW of rotation ot this WFS
wfs(1).shift          = [3,1]; // in pixels
</pre>
Note that in the display, the WFS spots are not rotated, it is the phase and amplitude that are rotated, so the rotation of e.g. the DM appears CW in the display (but the WFS is indeed rotated CCW). Enjoy the new feature. This could bring interesting gains in tomographic systems.

    <div id="entrytitle">yao 5.0 out</div>
    <div id="entrybody">
      <p>I just pushed version 5.0 to github. 
      The main changes with respect to the previous 4.9 version is
      <ol>
      <li>A faster yao (at least for shwfs and cwfs, but it will also affect any
      as the PSF computation is faster)</li>
      <li>A revamped shwfs, new features (extended field, spotpitch, new 
      handling of lgs elongation) </li>
      </ol>
    <p>This work has mostly been motivated by the need for faster ELT simulations.
    I am now using it for <b>GMT simulations</b>, 6 LGS WFS, each of them 60x60 subapertures
    with 10 arcsec field of view, elongated LGS, physical image formation, all that
    at <b>6 iterations/seconds</b> using yao w/ svipc on a 4 core hyperthreaded laptop (retina 
    Macbook Pro). That means 100000 subapertures/seconds. 
    <p>Here is the printout of test-all.i:

</pre>
So that the simple geometrical SH6x6 now runs at 2000 it/s, and the curvature-36
is getting close to 1000 it/s. Part of this is Moore's law, and part are further
optimizations of the code.

On the feature side, there is now a more complete model of SHWFS that allows to 
define independently field of view, field stop size and spotpitch, as illustrated 
in this sketch:
<center><img src="shwfs_yao_geometry.png" width="50%"/></center>
<p>The definition is all <b>backward compatible</b>, so your old parfiles should not be 
affected.</p>

<h4>Shack-Hartmann extended field</h4>
<p>One new interesting feature gained by Shack-Hartmann WFS is the so 
called "extended field" capability (wfs.extfield [arcsec]). Here is how it works:
Up to now the subaperture field of view was wfs.pixsize*wfs.npixels. This was 
limited to a certain value, namely wfs.lambda/pupil_plane_pixel_size_in_meter, 
constrained by the laws of the FFT. For instance at 500nm and with 10cm per pixel
in the pupil plane, you get one arcsec field of view. Period. This limits still 
applies with the new model,
but now this 1x1 arcsec "imagelet" is embedded into a larger image, with shifts
computed from the average input tilt in front of the given subaperture (of course
the said tilt is removed from the input phase as it is effectively taken care of 
by the shift). This opens the possibility of much larger dynamical ranges without
having to use a very large number of pixels in the input pupil. As far as turbulence
goes, this also relieves the constraint of having 2-3 pixels per r0: Now that 
tip-tilt is "removed" before doing the FFT to compute the subaperture spot, the 
wrapping limit of 2pi per pixel is pushed further away (about 3 times further 
if we trust Noll, as the Tip-tilt-removed Noll residual is 13% of the phase 
variance, thus 36% in rms). Thus one can now safely go to one pixel per r0 before
hitting the wrapping/aliasing limit on the image formation in each subaperture.
This means 2 times lower sim.pupildiam are needed, and typically translate into 
<i>a factor of 4 gain in speed</i> (trust me, more on that in a later post). 
I hope that makes sense. </p>

      In the early times (version < 2.0), pyramid WFS were once

      to remove the feature. They are now back in yao 4.8.0, thanks to another
      contribution from Marcos van Dam, with some tweaking from
      myself. The speed is reasonable, with approximately 70

      <p>The <b>new parallel features</b> (see next post), and especially the
      <b>new sparse reconstructor</b> options (see 2 posts below)
      makes running very large systems much more tractable than
      before. A <b>100x100 Shack-Hartmann system</b> (on a 400 pixels pupil)
      runs at <b>8 iterations/seconds</b> on an 8 core Xeon-based machine @
      3.33GHz! So one can get statiscally meaningful results in a few
      mn. It's not too greedy in RAM either (in modern machine
      standard) at 120MB for the main process (our machine has 8GB of
      RAM).</p>
      <p>A 64x64 system runs at 23 iterations/s and a 200x200 SHWFS at
      1 iterations/s (note that the later starts to be
      in the realm of ELT extreme AO, at 15cm actuator pitch on a 30-m). </p>

      <p>More work on yao parallel:
        <ul>
          <li>I have merged some of the -useful- parallel features
          implemented in our Gemini local yao_mcao to the yao
          trunk. Namely,
            <ul>
              <li>The DM/WFS parallelization (meaning, taking
          advantage of the fact that real systems have at least one
          frame delay (remember that even if the command is applied
          immediately after the measurements are received, there is
          still one frame delay due to the zero order hold). The one
          frame delay means the WFSing at iteration N is not needed to
          compute the command at iteration N, thus can be computed in
          parallel.</li>
              <li>The PSF calculations, which is a no brainer.</li>
            </ul>
          <li> I have implemented the parallelization of individual
          SHWFS. Meaning, an individual SHWFS can now run in parallel
          on an arbitrary number of "threads" (in fact, forks). This
          works only for Shack-Hartmann WFS. The good thing is that
          this is implemented fairly deep into the code, so any call
          to sh_wfs() will benefit from this, which means the iMat
          acquisition is accelerated too.</li>
        </ul>
        <em>Depending on your system, i.e. WFS order, number of WFSs/DMs,
        whether you use dm.elt or not, sparse reconstructor or not,
        and more importantly, on the machine you run yao on, using the
        parallel features can make you gain anywhere between 20% and
        200% in execution speed</em>. If you want to use it, you will most
        probably have to experiment a bit to see what option should be
        set. Guidelines are given in the manual. The bottom line is
        that you should not use more forks (processes) than you have
        CPUs, otherwise swapping processes in/out of L2 cache
        introduce an overhead which cancels the paralleization
        advantage. With my core2duo laptop, I can typically gain 30 to
        50%. With an 8 cores Xeon-based machine we have at work, I
        gain typically close to a factor of 2 (can be more or
        less). This does not seem particularly impressive, but one has
        to consider that a yao loop is made of many different
        individual operations: WFS, cMat product to retrieve the
        error, DM shape computation from the DM commands and the
        influence functions, PSF calculation, etc... So a gain in one
        of this items is only going to benefit the whole thing
        marginally. As far as the individual WFS parallelization is
        concerned, here are some hard numbers:
        <pre>8 Core Xeon (2 boards) @ 3.33GHz, running RHEL 5, 32 bits. yorick/yao built with -O2.
16x16 SHWFS system, physical model, no noise. All times (avg &amp; median) in milliseconds for one frame.

sh16x16_svipc:        1 threads, sh_wfs() avg=2.86, median=2.90
sh16x16_svipc:        2 threads, sh_wfs() avg=1.87, median=1.89
sh16x16_svipc:        4 threads, sh_wfs() avg=1.37, median=1.37
sh16x16_svipc:        8 threads, sh_wfs() avg=1.14, median=1.15
sh16x16_svipc:       16 threads, sh_wfs() avg=2.33, median=2.30</pre>
        You can see that the speed increases up to 8 forks (max gain =
        2.5x). Adding more forks makes the thing slower. The gain does
        not reach larger value just because (1) there are overheads
        associated to the use of shared memory/semaphores and (2)
        there is also a global overhead in the sh_wfs()
        function. What's parallelize is the core of sh_wfs() (FFTs,
        noise application and slopes calculations from spots), but any
        overhead within the sh_wfs() function itself, before calling
        the FFT/slopes calculation routine is not going to gain from
        the parallelization. </p>
      <p>The gain brought by the other, more general parallel features
      (DM/WFS &amp; PSFs) is nicely illustrated by the following
      examples. This was run on the same machine (8 cores Xeon), with
      curvature.par (36 subapertures curvature system ran on a 120
      pixels pupil). Look at the following results (I have omitted the
      timing results for items that are not of concerned here and were
      negligible):</p>
<pre>sim.svipc=0 (no parallelization)
time(1-2) =  9.89 ms  (WF sensing)
time(3-4) =  0.01 ms  (cMat multiplication)
time(4-5) =  1.04 ms  (DM shape computation)
time(5-6) =  5.84 ms  (Target PSFs estimation)
59.18 iterations/second in average


sim.svipc=1 (WFS/DM parallelized)
time(1-2) =  4.11 ms  (WF sensing)
time(3-4) =  0.01 ms  (cMat multiplication)
time(4-5) =  0.94 ms  (DM shape computation)
time(5-6) =  5.78 ms  (Target PSFs estimation)
91.43 iterations/second in average

sim.svipc=2 (PSFs parallelized)
time(1-2) = 10.69 ms  (WF sensing)
time(3-4) =  0.01 ms  (cMat multiplication)
time(4-5) =  1.05 ms  (DM shape computation)
time(5-6) =  1.23 ms  (Target PSFs estimation)
76.41 iterations/second in average</pre>

      <p>That's a typical example. The "no parallel" case is dominated by
        WFSing (10ms) and PSF (6ms) calculations. When parallelizing the WFS
        (sim.svipc=1), the WFSing time goes down to 4ms. Indeed, now 6ms of it
        can be done in parallel with other tasks: here, the PSF calculation
        that takes 6ms. With sim.svipc=2 (only the PSF are parallelized), the
        PSF calculation time goes to basically to 0 while the WFSing stays at
        10ms. It all makes sense. I haven't put the sim.svipc=3 results as
        they are a little more difficult to understand and would just
        introduce confusion.</p>


      <p>The individual WFS parallel feature is controlled by the
        parameter wfs.svipc. The "global" DMs/WFSs abd PSF
        parallelization is controlled by sim.svipc (bit 0 controls
        DM/WFS and bit 1 controls PSFs, thus sim.svipc=3 means both are
        turned on).</p>
      <p>Of course, if you want to use yao parallel facilities, you
      will need to install the yorick-svipc plugin (contributed by
      <b>Matthieu Bec</b>), through most of
      the normal channels. It runs on Linux (extensively tested) and
      OsX (somewhat tested).</p>

      <p>Following the development here at Gemini of a svipc plugin
        (by <b>Matthieu Bec</b>),
        providing shared memory capabilities for yorick, I have been
        working on parallelizing yao. The results so far are
        encouraging. For instance, I get a 4x performance boost on
        simulation of our MCAO system here, from 12 it/s to 47 it/s on
        an 8 core Xeon machine. This will of course work better for
        systems with multiple WFS and/or DMs, but will probably also
        bring some improvements for simpler systems.</p>
      <p>Right now, I have implemented this in our version of yao
      that we forked to accomodate our special MCAO needs. But the
      functions are rather generic and I do not foresee major hurdles
      in porting that to the main yao tree. I just need to get a few
      free hours... So stay tuned!</p>

            <li> Changed all function names from old style (with capitals,  e.g. checkParameters) to new style (no capital, but underscores, e.g. check_parameters). To keep the API compatibility with existing user code, I have copied the function names into the old names (see API compatibility section at the end of yao.i).</li>
            <li> Beside that, there shouldn't be any API change (in the sense that it should be compatible with old API, I have added a couple of keywords here and there). <strong>Most importantly, 4.5 should still be completely compatible with your old parfiles</strong>. However, it is <strong>not</strong> compatible with binary configurations saved with previous versions (the *imat.fits and other fits files). This means that you will have to remember to re-run aoinit with option clean=1 to re-create these binary config files.</li>
            <li> One worthy API change is the addition of the keyword all= to the go function (see doc), that you should now use in scripts/batches.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Slow down imat display (use sleep=value in ms)</li>
        <li>Added flip of DM and new stackarray influence functional forms</li>
        <li>Added transversal shift (misregistration) of WFS (SHWFS)</li>
        <li>Added transversal shift (misregistration) of DM (already existed, but this is for large integer offsets)</li>
      </ul>

<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>"Desired" pixel size is wrong (SHWFS)
    <li>Bug with extrapolated counted several time (clean=1)
    <li>Solved zernike influence function for altitude DM
    <li>Merged many new things from yao_mcao
    <li>Can now use dm.elt with aniso modes
    <li>Skymag not set to zero when doing imat
    <li>Fixed bug in which user would be stuck at prompt when doing interactive SVD
    <li>DispImImav reverse behavior from expected
    <li>Setting npixpersub is not taken into account system wide
    <li>Fixed a small bug in phase screen generation (max offseted (1,1) in power spectrum)
    <li>Fixed mess in actuator/subaperture order. now both go from bottom left to top right, in line (i.e. subap/act#2 is at right of subap/act#1)
    <li>Updated many help document section (yao.i, yao_wfs.i)</li>

  </ul>

<p>So, as you see, lots of new things. I apologize to those who knew well the yao code and for who this release is going to mean some work to find where the functions have gone, but I think the code re-organization was way overdue, and the results is cleaner. Many of these modifications were the results of a visit from Michael Hart (and some push from Marcos van Dam) to use yao for GMT simulations. As usual, I have benefited from many discussions, advices and code contribution from Damien Gratadour, Benoit Neichel, Yann Clenet and Eric Gendron. </p>

<p>Things I have missed in this release but that I firmly intend to implement in the next version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smarter reconstructors: MMSE (MVR, MAP), may be POLC (contribution Benoit Neichel).</li>
  <li>More advanced centroiding algorithm: weighted, ... (contribution Yann Clenet).</li>
  <li>Cleaner display routines, separately callable.</li>
  <li>Hexagonal stackarray geometry.</li>
  <li>Hexagonal curvature WFS and DM geometry.</li>
  <li>Phase screen generation on the fly (contribution Damien Gratadour and Eric Gendron).</li>
  <li>Off-axis projectors for Rayleigh background (contribution Damien Gratadour).</li>
  <li>Your code here :-)</li>

    <div id="entrytitle">Breaking the 1000 iterations/s barrier: a performance update</div>
    <div id="entrybody">


    <p>Is the performance of today's computer still following Moore's law? If so, if
    I take my numbers of the section performance,
    that date back to 2004, we should get for the fastest case (sh6m2-bench.par)
    170*2^5 = 5540 it/sec. That is not the case, but I re-run recently some tests
    on typical cases and I am happy to announce that the <em><strong>threshold of
    1000 iterations/second has been passed</strong></em>. Here are some
    performance numbers, obtained on a MacBook Pro 17" (running Snow Leopard, aka
    10.6.1, 2.66GHz, 4GB RAM, 64bits yorick and plugins). All simulations were
    runs with 4 phase screens, and the display on, unless noted otherwise. Results
    are in iterations/second.</p>

    <center>
    <table border="0">
          <tr class="toptitle"><td>Name   </td><td> case                                           </td><td>  64bits </td><td>  32bits  </td></tr>
    <tr class="trodd"><td><a href="ashfast-bench.par">shfast</a></td><td> SH 6x6 geometrical, 1DM+TT, NGS, 1 screen, no display </td><td>  1020   </td><td>  860     </td></tr>

    </table>
    </center>

    <p>Those are all, I believe, fairly impressive numbers. Because I acquired this
    macbook only recently, I was doing comparison between a 32bits and 64bits
    yorick. Hence the last column of the table. Building/running in 64bits
    actually makes a fairly big difference on Snow Leopard. In average, the 64 bit
    version is 25% faster than the 32 bits one (up to 42% faster in some cases).
    That's a big gain.</p>

    <div id="entrytitle">Install Update</div>
    <div id="entrybody">
    Obviously, I have been postponing for far too long updates on this
    site. Yao is not dead, no. I and many other people are still using it almost
    daily. But I just didn't have the time nor the inclination to update
    this site.

    <p>I got several requests recently to help install yao <b>on
    OsX</b> (I believe the yao packages have been built for 10.5, so I
    don't think the following would work for Tiger 10.4).
    So, I wrote up some fairly detailled instructions. Here is the drill.
    Note that I do not believe that there is any pre-requisite (beside X11
    of course). I tested that on a fresh test account in my mac and it
    worked. FFTW comes bundled with the yao package, so it is not
    necessary to install it.

    <p><i>Note: in fact, the following should also work on linux. Just select
    	the appropriate OS in pkg_setup when asked for it.</i>

    <br>
    <ol>
    <li> Install the last yorick

      <ul>
        <li> download yorick from http://sourceforge.net/projects/yorick/files/yorick/2.1.05/yorick-2.1.05-mac-intel.tgz/download
        <li> unpack and move yorick-2.1.05 directory to ~
        <li> add yorick path to your default path: add this line at the end of your ~/.profile
    <pre>export PATH=$HOME/yorick-2.1.05/bin:$PATH</pre>
      </ul>

    <li> Install yao:
    <br>
    <code>pkg_mngr.i</code> is now bundled with yorick. So just do the
    following (for
    <code>pkg_setup</code>: all
    defaults are good, so carriage return everywhere, except you will have to
    select the OS: darwin-i686 on modern apple machines)

    <pre>$ yorick
#include "pkg_mnr.i"
> pkg_setup
> pkg_sync
> pkg_list
> pkg_install,"yao"
> quit</pre>

    <li> Setup yao:

    First you'll have to create phase screens (once forever unless you want new ones):

    <pre>$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p .yorick/data
$ cd .yorick/data
$ yorick -i turbulence.i
> require,"yao.i"
> CreatePhaseScreens,2048,256,prefix="screen"
> quit
$ ls   ( you should have your screens)</pre>

    <li> Run yao

    <pre>$ cd ~/yorick-2.1.05/share/yao/examples/</pre>
    That's where some example yao parfile are. you can then put them wherever you want and transform/adapt them at will.
    <pre>$ yorick -i yao.i
> aoread,"sh6x6.par"
> aoinit,disp=1
> aoloop,disp=1
> go
</pre>
    watch it go :-)

    <div id="entrydate">4 December 2005</div>
    <div id="entrytitle">Version 3.6</div>
    <div id="entrybody">
    Very, very long time I haven't posted here, or updated this site for that matter !
    <p>I know many people have had problems installing yao with the newest yorick releases. Since the yorick Makefile system has been re-hauled in fact. Well, many things have changed. Now you can install yao *very* easily from the yorick prompt. Just download the brand <a href="http://www.maumae.net/yorick/contrib/pkg_mngr.i">new binary plugin installer</a> (require yorick > 1.6.02). To install the latest yao, just:</p>
    <pre>#include "pkg_mngr.i"
pkg_list
pkg_install,"yao"
</pre>
    <p>beware that the install directive will install in yorick/contrib/yao, so if you have there an existing installation that you want to preserve, you should back it up before.</p>

    <p>This yao version is kind of intermediary. I have not included all modifications from ralf. I have however made a fairly decent size change to aoloop:</p>

    Now aoloop is in 2 parts:
    <pre>aoloop,parameters_as_before</pre>
    to "load" the thing.
    then type
    <pre>go</pre> or <pre>go,1</pre> to run a single iteration.

    <p>While it's going, you now still have access to the prompt. You can type "stop" or "cont" to stop/resume the loop simulations.</p>
    <p>If you write batches in which you run loops, you will have to write it like this:
    <pre>aoloop,bla-bla-bla
for (j=1;j<=loop.niter;j++) go;</pre>

    This is because a call to go goes only through one loop cycle, and then call "set_idler,go", which tells to the yorick interpreter "if you have nothing pending, run 'go'". This will work as intended when ran interactively, but when in a batch, the interpreter is not idle: it will execute directly the next line and will never go back to "go" if not forced to (hence the explicit loop).

    <div id="entrytitle">Rayleigh and photometry revamp</div>
    <div id="entrybody">
    I've just been working on implementing the Rayleigh fratricide effect in yao.
    This is an important feature in systems using multiple LGS beams with CW lasers. A WFS looking at a star may intersect the rayleigh plume from another star and thus see an increased background. This effect is particularly important to model for MCAO as CW laser is a possibility. First, I wanted to branch yao, and do a quick and dirty implementation of the Rayleigh, not planning to release it. I reconsidered after seeing that it was not going to take that much more work to actually make it user-friendly, so here we are with version 3.3. I also went ahead and implemented a clean zenith dependance. Now there is a parameter (gs.zenithangle) that sets the zenith angle (see below). Beware that the definition of photometry has slightly changed: now the zero point is for the number of photons at the entrance pupil, not anymore detected by the WFS. An way to enter the optical throughput on a WFS basis is provided (see below).

    </center>
    <br><br>


    <p>Below is the excerpt of the README file relevant to this release:
    <ul>
    <li> semi major changes in this version. Watch out, as some parameters meaning has changed (I know this is silly, but it's more logical now).
    <li>Implemented zenith dependance. Now one can change one parameter (gs.zenithangle) and everything change as needed (r0, lgs altitude
    and thickness of Na layer, atm layer altitude, LGS brightness)
    <li> Imlemented Rayleigh fratricide effect for multiple LGS systems!
    This was quite an endeavour. I had to modify the _shwfs routine
    to include several new lines and parameters relative to Rayleigh
    and calibration (a side effect is that we can now do and use calibration frame in this routine). To enable Rayleigh calculations set wfs.rayleighflag to 1 (it will *not* be calculated for NGS WFS as it is assumed that you can easily block the light from the laser wavelength).
    <li> The way to specify the photometry has also changed. Now, if you deal with a LGS, you specify a power and a return per watt, not anymore a magnitude (magnitude are still ok for a NGS). Also, everything -in term of zeropoints- is now specified at the entrance of the telescope: gs.zeropoint is now the number of photons for a zero mag star per sec per pupil at M1 (it used to be detected by the WFS). gs.lgsreturnperwatt is also in photons at M1. Instead, I have added a wfs.optthroughput parameter to specify the optical throughput of each WFS. Please set it, as it defaults to 1.
    <li> In summary, the following keywords were added in the parfile:
    <ul>
    <li> gs.lgsreturnperwatt
    <li> gs.zenithangle
    <li> wfs.laserpower
    <li> wfs.rayleighflag
