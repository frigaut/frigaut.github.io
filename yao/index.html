   <a href="images/yao_mcao_gui.png"><img src="images/yao_mcao_gui.png" width="35%"  class="imglink" style="float:right;" /></a>
   <b>Yao</b> is a Monte-Carlo AO simulation tool. It uses a number of custom developed functions to simulate wavefront sensors (WFS), deformable mirrors (DM) and many other aspects of an AO loop.


   <h3>Highlights</h3>
   <ul class="spaced">

     <li><font class="highlight">Coded in <a href="http://yorick.sourceforge.net">yorick</a></font>, a open source scripting language similar to IDL or mathlab (powerful and free!). The core, CPU intensive routines are coded in C. Yorick and the YAO plugins are written in ANSI-C, which makes them portable on many platforms. YAO should run on any *nix platform, including Linux, Mac OsX, BSD, cygwin, etc... It may also work on windows, but I have never tried.</li>

     <li>
       <font class="highlight">Shack-Hartmann</font>,
       <font class="highlight">Curvature</font>,
       <font class="highlight">Pyramid</font> and
       <font class="highlight">Modal</font> (Zernike)
       <font class="highlight">WFS</font>,
       ON or OFF axis, are supported. It is also possible
       to <font class="highlight">add your own
       WFS</font> <font class="new">NEW 4.5</font>.
     </li>
     <li>
       <font class="highlight">Stackarray</font> (piezostack),
       <font class="highlight">curvature</font> (bimorph),
       <font class="highlight">segmented</font> <font class="new">NEW 4.5</font>, (experimental),
       <font class="highlight">modal</font> (zernike,
       disk-marmonic <font class="new">NEW 4.6</font> or
       KL) and
       <font class="highlight">Tip-Tilt deformable mirrors</font>
       are supported. The altitude of conjugation is adjustable. It is
       also possible  to <font class="highlight">add your own
       DM</font> <font class="new">NEW 4.5</font>.
     </li>
     <li><font class="highlight">Various reconstructors:
     least-square with truncation (SVD) and MMSE-like</font>. MMSE can use
     either full matrix or sparse methods (fast). Users can hook into
     yao and use their own code to compute the
     reconstructor <font class="new">NEW 4.5.2</font></li>
     <li>An <font class="highlight">arbitrary number of WFSs and DMs</font> 
     can be used, with the possibility of mixing types. It is therefore 
     possible to simulate single DM systems, as well as single non-zero 
     conjugate, GLAO and MCAO systems. WFS and DM can be grouped in
     subsystems, to isolate behavior, as can typically be found in 
     LGS high order and NGS TT control in LGS systems.
     </li>
     <li>It supports <font class="highlight">Natural and Laser Guide 
     Stars</font> (or a mix). LGS support include spot blurring and elongation 
     with a user supplied LGS profile (there are templates), uplink jitter 
     correction and more.
     </li>
     <li>It supports <font class="highlight">photon and read-out noise</font>.
     </li>
     <li>It uses a multi-layered atmospheric model, with geometrical propagation only.
     </li>
     <li>The loop execution has been <font class="highlight">optimized
       for speed</font>: the critical routines have been coded in
       C. Yorick is thus used as a convenient "glue" between lower
       levels optimized C calls. Overall, this is rather efficient: A
       simple 6x6 Shack-Hartmann system (geometrical model, no
       diffraction) runs at <font class="highlight">over 3300
       iterations/seconds</font> on modern machines (about 530it/sec
       for a full diffractive 6x6 SHWFS). That's including turbulent phase
       computation, wavefront sensing, reconstruction, calculation of
       the DM shape and PSF/performance estimation.  A 64x64
       Shack-Hartmann (full diffraction model) system runs at about 29
       iterations/s for an 30-m telescope. A 188 curvature system runs
       at over 269 iterations/s (see the <a href="news.html#yao_5.0">this
       entry</a> for more details). Medium-size AO systems for ELTs
       can also be simulated. It takes more time and RAM, but is still quite 
       performant: On my 4GHz i7 iMac, simulating the GMT LTAO system 
       (6 LGS WFS each 60x60 subapertures, including spot elongation) runs at
       6 iterations/seconds and take slightly over 1.5 GB or RAM. 
       YAO can be used in parallel mode, using the yorick svipc plugin. 
       See <a href="news.html#Parallel_yao_released_with_improvements">this
       post</a> in the news. On modern hardware, it is now possible to
       simulate up to 200x200 SHWFS. A 64x64SHWFS runs
       at 23 iterations/s).
     </li>
     <li>Straightforward <font class="highlight">scriptability</font> to 
     probe parameter space.
     </li>
     <li>An (optional) GTK <font class="highlight">GUI</font> provides a 
     convenient interface. One can, e.g., change some of the system parameters 
     <font class="highlight">while the loop is running</font>. This provides 
     an educational approach to Adaptive Optics (newbies can play with the 
     parameters and immediately sees how the system reacts) and can also 
     provides a quick way to investigate the stability conditions for a newly 
     designed system, before entering more serious Monte-carlo simulations. 
     Note that because the GUI is GTK-based, it requires the gnome libraries. 
     These come automatically in Linux and BSD, but are a bit more challenging 
     to install on OsX (but possible with 
     <a href="http://www.macports.org/">macport</a> or 
     <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">fink</a>). 
     Note that the GUI is not essential to run YAO.

   </ul>
   <h3>Other capabilities</h3>
   <ul class="spaced">
     <li>Arbitrary aperture shape (defined through a user plugin). Disk with 
     central obstruction is the stock pupil, but examples are provided to 
     create segmented or GMT like pupils.</li>
     <li>Partitioning of DMs and WFSs in independent subsystems (e.g. for 
     separate control of TT in LGS systems)
     </li>
     <li>2 methods for Shack-Hartmann:
       <ol>
         <li>Simple gradient average, no noise, very fast: This allow to do 
         tests of the noiseless performance of a system, for quick performance 
         evaluation of system dimensioning
         </li>
         <li>Full propagation, with subaperture image
         formation. Includes adjustable subaperture and pixel size,
         photon and read-out noise, bias and flat field errors,
         thresholding, convolution by a gaussian kernel and image
         elongation in the case of LGS. Proper overlap between
         subapertures and possibility to put a field stop with
         adjustable shape, size and position <font class="new">NEW 4.5</font> .

     <li>Rayleigh Fratricide effect for multiple sodium beacon systems</li>
     <li>Extrapolated actuators</li>
     <li>Centroid Gain optimization, using LGS dithering (only for LGS + 
     Shack-Hartmann)</li>
     <li>Parametrizable vibration spectrum: white, 1/f, peaks with
     adjustable rms and width <font class="new">NEW 4.5</font>
     <li>Lots of internal variables are accessible from the outside of the 
     program for debugging/implementation of new features</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Comments and shorcomings</h3>
   <ul class="spaced">
     <li>Dependency on <font class="highlight">FFTW</font> for the
     fast FFT C implementation.</li>
     <li>Dependencies on the following yorick packages: yutils
     (general utilities, v&ge;1.3), imutil (image manipulation,
     v&ge;0.5), soy (sparse operations with yorick, v&ge;1.2) and svipc (v0.9)</li>
     <li>The set-up routines (aoinit) have not yet been optimized for speed, 
     thus, in particular, inverting large matrices can take some time. This 
     optimization may come in due time, if deemed necessary.</li>
     <li>
       <font class="highlight">There is no GUI to configure the systems</font>. 
       The parfile has to be edited manually, which in my view is not a big 
       deal and actually allows for more compact &amp; clever parfiles, as 
       yorick loops can be used to set repetitive variables.
     </li>
     <li>Scintillation is not supported, as it has been shown by many studies 
     to be negligible at NIR wavelengths.
     </li>
