- What are refracting and reflecting telescopes?
- Why put telescopes in space?

## Measuring Light

- The light from other worlds contains vast amounts of information about those worlds. 
- Why can’t we just use our eyes to study this light?

## Eyes?

- Visible only
- Eyes can’t make records of what they see
- Can’t see dim light, blinded by bright light
- Different eyes have different properties

- But eyes are a good prototype for understanding cameras and telescopes

## The Eye
- Pupil<img src="assets/images/fop_100.png" style="display:inline;float:right;margin-left:15px;" width="600px"> - Control how much light comes in
- Lens -  Brings the light together where it can be measured
- Retina – Measures the light, sends results to computer
